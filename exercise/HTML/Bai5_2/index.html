  <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
  <p>
    This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique
    called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn
    >. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
    in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target
    temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,
    <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as
    <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.

    Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To
    reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before

    Warning: <dfn>Sous vide</dfn> cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if
    you are pregnant or have immunity issues.
